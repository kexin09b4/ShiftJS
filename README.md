# ShiftJS

##### Stand-alone JavaScript library that triggers native CSS3 transition-based animations in modern browsers.

Full documentation and examples to come soon...

##### Browser Support:

* IE10+
* Firefox 34+
* Chrome 31+
* Safari 7.1+
* Opera 26+

_In older browsers, some transform-based animations will not work if the browser does not natively support the feature. All other CSS changes will be applied normally albeit without a smooth CSS3 transition._
